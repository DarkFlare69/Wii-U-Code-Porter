# Wii U Code Porter
This is a program I made to port Wii U Cafe codes to the new codehandler if you're still using the old codehandler.

# Usage
1. Download the program (.exe).
2. Put your code into one of the two textboxes.
3. Press convert to other codehandler to port the code.
4. Copy the new code.
